A *FreeCodeCamp* challenge on using front end libraries to build a Random Quote Machine with the below user stories to be fulfilled:

> 1. I can see a wrapper element with a corresponding id="quote-box".
> 2. Within #quote-box, I can see an element with a corresponding id="text".
> 3. Within #quote-box, I can see an element with a corresponding id="author".
> 4. Within #quote-box, I can see a clickable element with a corresponding id="new-quote".
> 5. Within #quote-box, I can see a clickable element with a corresponding id="tweet-quote".
> 6. On first load, my quote machine displays a random quote in the element with id="text".
> 7. On first load, my quote machine displays the random quote's author in the element with id="author".
> 8. When the #new-quote button is clicked, my quote machine should fetch a new quote and display it in the #text element.
> 9. My quote machine should fetch the new quote's author when the #new-quote button is clicked and display it in the #author element.
> 10. I can tweet the current quote by clicking on the #tweet-quote a element. This a element should include the "twitter.com/intent/tweet" path in it's href attribute to tweet the current quote.
> 11. The #quote-box wrapper element should be horizontally centered. Please run tests with browser's zoom level at 100% and page maximized.
